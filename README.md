# Frontends

Scroll's Monorepo for Frontends


## Purpose

The final goal for this repo is to contain a single React app written in TypeScript to accommodate for all frontend functionality, optimising for a smooth frontend user exprience.


## Status Quo

Currently, the individual frontend modules are linked to as submodules. The `dev-portal` module is being refactored first and will live here as the starting point of the target single-app structure.

This repo will also contain re-usable components such as Header and Footer for use in the submodules while we transition.
